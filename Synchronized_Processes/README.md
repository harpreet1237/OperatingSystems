1. This mini-project deals with the synchronization of two slow IO tasks using semaphores.
2. It focusses on how we can simulataneously run two different very slow processes without compromising the
   sequence of processes in order to maintain consistency in output.
3. This can be easily extended to taking input from Scanner and giving output to printer like slow output device without compromising the consistency of flow of processes.
